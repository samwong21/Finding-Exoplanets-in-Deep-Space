## Project Name: Finding exoplanets using Star Flux data from NASA

Group Members: Samantha Wong, Megha Velakacharla, Lumyah Habib

Description: 

This project is about finding exoplanets in deep space using recorded changes in flux
or light intensity for 5087 stars. To do so, we will implement binary classification to classify stars with and without orbiting exoplanets. The input used to train our machine learning algorithm is a csv data set from Kaggle that documents 5087 stars, their binary classification, and 9 different time periods where their flux was recorded. The other input is the test data set containing another 570 stars with their recorded flux values, but without a classification. Our algorithm will analyze this test set of 570 stars and find the stars that have orbiting exoplanets. Therefore, the ultimate output will be the test data set with the addition of their binary classification.

This is a public dataset from Kaggle containing cleaned data from observations made by the NASA Kepler space telescope. There are 68 notebooks of code, using different methods of machine learning to analyze the data.
